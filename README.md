## Dataset:

Marathon finisher results from the Berlin marathon between 1999 and 2019.

## Why are we choosing this dataset?

We have both decided to choose this dataset due to our involvement in the sport. As casual runners, we have developed an interest in marathon performance trends and how they have evolved over time. The dataset we have chosen is sufficiently large and detailed, making it appropriate for analyzing different factors that may have impacts on the advancement of the sport. More notably, we are curious how different factors such as shoe technology, performance trends, etc. have changed over the years.
